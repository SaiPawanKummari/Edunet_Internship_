# AI-POWERED-Plant-Disease-Detection
A deep learning project aimed at detecting and classifying plant diseases from images to aid farmers in early diagnosis and crop management. The project is structured in four phases: dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
# Features
**Image Classification**: Identifies different plant diseases based on leaf images.
**Data-Driven**: Utilizes a dataset of labeled images for training and validation.
**Step-by-Step Development**: The project is divided into four phases, each building upon the last, from data collection to model deployment.
# Technologies Used
**Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and model implementation.
**TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building and training the neural network model.
**OpenCV**: For image preprocessing and augmentation.
**Google-colab**: To document the project phases and results and also for GPU to train the model fast.
